# 0x17. Web stack debugging #3

By Sylvain Kalache, co-founder at Holberton School

## Tasks

### 0. Strace is your friend

Using  `strace`, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash as you were previously doing).

Hint:

-   `strace`  can attach to a current running process
-   You can use  [tmux](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/4KkxME6-3aY9fgfok6HNFA "tmux")  to run  [strace](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/OUc10nTtuZG65adFVbkYag "strace")  in one window and  `curl`  in another one

Requirements:

-   Your  `0-strace_is_your_friend.pp`  file must contain Puppet code
-   You can use whatever Puppet resource type you want for you fix
