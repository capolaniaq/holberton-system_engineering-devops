Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:

### 1. Install nginx web server

Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, letâ€™s install one!

### 2. Setup a domain name

Readme:

-   [Replace a line with multiple lines with sed](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Afg1zCifjmIygL1se0ghhg "Replace a line with multiple lines with sed")

Configure your Nginx server so that  `/redirect_me`  is redirecting to another page.


### 4. Not found page 404

Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string `Ceci n'est pas une page`.
