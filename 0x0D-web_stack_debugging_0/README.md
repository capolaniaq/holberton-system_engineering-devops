## Tasks

### 0. Give me a page!

Be sure to read the  **Docker**  concept page

In this first debugging project, you will need to get  [Apache](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/B4vOap4dPNKxdZzBbepK7Q "Apache")  to run on the container and to return a page containing  `Hello Holberton`  when querying the root of it.
